# DeFi AI Agent

## Overview
DeFi AI Agent is an intelligent assistant designed to help users manage their crypto portfolios with ease. It leverages AI-powered tools to optimize asset allocation, predict token prices, and automate portfolio management based on market trends.

## Features

### 1. **Portfolio Rebalancing**
- Users can specify their desired asset allocation in percentages (e.g., 30% stablecoins, 40% native tokens, 30% other assets).
- The agent automatically swaps assets to maintain the specified ratio.

### 2. **AI-Powered Price Prediction & Smart Swaps**
- Predicts token prices using AI algorithms.
- If a token is predicted to increase by more than 5%, the agent swaps underperforming tokens to that asset to maximize gains.

### 3. **Portfolio Diversification Analysis**
- Analyzes the user’s portfolio and provides diversification insights.
- Suggests optimal allocation between different asset classes such as stablecoins, native tokens, and alternative assets.

### 4. **Trending Token Discovery**
- Identifies trending tokens on the blockchain.
- Helps users stay ahead of market movements and invest in promising assets.

### 5. **Automatic Loss Protection**
- Continuously monitors the user’s portfolio.
- If any token falls by more than 20% in the last 24 hours, the agent automatically swaps it into stablecoins to minimize losses.
